# ArDNC
ArDNC is an Arduino based program that is designed to transfer NC files from an SD card to a CNC machine via serial communications.  
The system will utilize a config.cfg file found in the root directory of the SD card to set up communication parameters and to locate where the NC files are stored.  It will have an Adafruit 16 x 2 LCD RGB Shield + 5 key keypad ( https://learn.adafruit.com/rgb-lcd-shield ) to allow the operator to control ArDNC
